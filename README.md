## Run 🏃‍♀️

Start the development server in one terminal window:

```
yarn start
```

And build the app with:

```
react-native run-ios
```

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Technologies used 🖥

* We used unstructured patient information leaflet data provided by the [AXA SwissMedic API](https://health.axa.ch/hack/). We parsed the XML, structured, sorted and extracted relevant information.
* We used [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as the framework to build the mobile app.

## Team 🤼‍♂️

Built as part of [HackZurich 2018](https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/). This project made it into the final of 25 projects out of 160 total submissions. Our [official submission is on DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/easypill).
