# EasyPill Mobile App

An easy-to-understand mobile app which breaks down complicated patient information leaflets for you.

Done as part of [HackZurich 2018](https://digitalfestival.ch/en/HACK/). Our [official submission is on DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/easypill).

We used unstructured patient information leaflet data provided by the [AXA SwissMedic API](https://health.axa.ch/hack/).
